# multi-scale sliding window face detector

##Task
1.convolution in the spatial domain and convolution in the frequency domain

2.Create Hybrid image

3.In this part, I implemented various parts of a sliding window object detector. In particular,I tasked with implementing a multi-scale face detector. I need to train an SVM to categorize 36 × 36 pixel images as “face” or “not face”, using HOG features. Used the VLFeat library (http://www.vlfeat.org/) for both HOG and the SVM.
